# Clothing-Store-React-Project  

### This is a simple React project of a design for a fake clothing store. The App was made using React JS, HTML and CSS. It's only a design, created with mostly styled-components, there's no real functionality. I designed a few pages for learning purposes and made the app responsive to mobile devices.  

### HomePage  

The Home Page of the app contains a navbar at the top with the selected language, a search input area, the name of the brand, register/login buttons, and a shopping cart icon. Below them, we have an announcements panel, and under that, a slider that changes between components with a small animation.

Next we can see categories components and single products. If we hover over a product, it will show the user a few options.

The two last components on this page are the Newsletter - just an input for user email and the Footer - here there are attachments for social media, some other useful links, and contact information.

### Product List  

On this page we have a list of items for a category, some filters and the ability to sort the found items. The navbar, announcement, newsletter, and footer are also on the page.

### Product Page  

This is a page for a single item. It contains information about the product, its price, available colors, size and quantity to choose from, and a button to add it to the cart.

### Register and Login  

Two similar components, they consist of just specific inputs and a button to confirm action. The Login page also has links for users if they want to register or they forgot their password.

### Cart  

The last page contains information about items in the cart. We can see all products currently in the basket, basic info about them, selected options (size, color, etc.), and an order summary that shows the user how much the total cost of their items is.

The App should also be mobile-friendly, as demonstrated by the cart page:
